This is a HTML website that we made based off of a prototype

Peer Review-Jovann: Layout for desktop is good links go to the right sections of the page and nav bar is responsive. The whole page is somewhat responsive some stuff does get out of place but thats just a minor issues its still looks better then mine. Other then that everything looks good its responsive and follows the prototype.
